## 1. What this is

A **payment reconciliation engine** built solo for the **Razorpay AI Buildathon, Track 4 (AI Finance Controller)**.
Locked: 2026-08-24 · **Submission: 2026-09-05.** 13-day build.

It ingests three deliberately messy synthetic financial sources, reconciles them through a tiered matching engine, classifies whatever it can't match into an exception taxonomy, explains those exceptions in plain English via an LLM, logs every decision immutably, and shows all of it on a dashboard.

**What the judges actually grade** (verbatim from the track page):

> "Throughput plus measured accuracy plus an honest exception list. One cherry-picked match proves nothing."

Three consequences that shape every decision in this repo:

1. **The exception list is the primary feature**, not a fallback path. Build it like the main thing, because it is.
2. **Accuracy must be *measured* against a ground-truth key**, not printed by the engine about itself. See [docs/validation-strategy.md](docs/validation-strategy.md).
3. **A panelist must be able to see the result without reading code.** The UI is not optional.

**Refusing to guess is a feature here.** If the engine is unsure, the correct behaviour is an exception with a stated reason — never a confident wrong match. Any change that raises match rate by guessing is a regression, however good the number looks.

## 2. Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript, everywhere. Node 22. |
| API | Express 5 |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 — **no Redis, no ORM.** Raw SQL via `pg`, numbered migration files. |
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router) + React |
| LLM | Anthropic API, `claude-sonnet-5`, explain layer only |
| Hosting | Vercel (web) + Railway (API + Postgres). **No Kubernetes, no containers we author.** |

Rationale for each is in [docs/adr-log.md](docs/adr-log.md). Don't re-litigate these — if you think one is wrong, append an ADR rather than quietly changing it.

---

## 3. Read these before changing anything

| Doc | What it owns |
|---|---|
| [docs/schema.md](docs/schema.md) | **The core doc.** Source schemas, normalized model, all table shapes, tolerance values, exception taxonomy + precedence, alias design, LLM prompt + caching. |
| [docs/api-contract.md](docs/api-contract.md) | Every endpoint. Frontend and backend are built on different days — **this contract is binding.** |
| [docs/adr-log.md](docs/adr-log.md) | Every locked decision with reasoning. Append-only. |
| [docs/validation-strategy.md](docs/validation-strategy.md) | Ground-truth generation, precision/recall scoring, the honesty protocols. |
| [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) | Hosting, env vars, secrets, deploy steps. |
| [docs/what-broke.md](docs/what-broke.md) | **Update daily.** Part of the submission. |

**If code and docs disagree, the docs are right until an ADR says otherwise.** Fix the doc first, add the ADR, then change code.

### Structural rules that matter

1. **All SQL lives in `repositories/`.** No query strings in routes or services. Non-negotiable — it's what keeps the schema knowable.
2. **`data/truth/` is never imported by `apps/api`.** Ground truth leaking into the engine invalidates every accuracy claim in the project. Scoring happens in `tools/score/`, offline. (ADR-021)
3. **Routes are thin.** Parse, validate, call a service, serialize. If a route has business logic, move it.
4. **The LLM never decides anything.** It writes prose about decisions the rules already made. Anything that gives the model influence over match/no-match or category is a bug. (ADR-017)
5. **`audit_log` is append-only,** enforced by a DB trigger. Never write an `UPDATE` against it. (ADR-015)
6. **Money is `BIGINT` paise.** Never a float, never a `number` holding rupees. (ADR-006)
7. **Frontend fetches only through `lib/api-client.ts`.** One place for the base URL, error envelope, and casing.

## 5. Naming conventions

| Thing | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| DB tables | `snake_case`, plural | `learned_aliases`, `match_members` |
| DB columns | `snake_case`; money always `_paise`; timestamps `_at`; dates `_date` | `amount_paise`, `approved_at`, `txn_date` |
| TS variables / fields | `camelCase` | `amountPaise`, `matchRatePct` |
| TS types / interfaces | `PascalCase`, no `I` prefix | `NormalizedTransaction`, `ExceptionDetail` |
| Files (TS) | `kebab-case.ts` | `tier2-fuzzy-matcher.ts` |
| React components | `PascalCase.tsx` | `ExceptionTable.tsx` |
| API routes | `kebab-case`, plural nouns | `/api/runs/:runId/review-queue` |
| Wire JSON | `camelCase` | `{ "amountPaise": 123450 }` |
| Migrations | `NNN_snake_case.sql`, zero-padded | `003_add_learned_aliases.sql` |
| Enum-ish values in DB | `SCREAMING_SNAKE` for taxonomy, `lower_snake` for states | `AMOUNT_MISMATCH`, `pending_review` |
| Rule IDs | `SCREAMING_SNAKE` + `_V<n>` | `EXACT_PAYMENT_ID_V1` |
| Env vars | `SCREAMING_SNAKE` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Git branches | `day<N>-<topic>` | `day4-matching-engine` |

**The `snake_case` ↔ `camelCase` boundary is the repository layer.** SQL in, camelCase objects out. Services and routes never see a `snake_case` key. One mapping point; no ambiguity about which convention applies where.

## 6. Domain vocabulary

Use these words precisely — they mean specific things here.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Source record** | One row from one of the three source files. Stored 1:1 in `transactions`. |
| **Economic event** | The real-world payment behind 1–3 source records. Exists in the answer key; the engine never sees it. |
| **Match** | A *group* of source records the engine believes are one economic event. Not a pair. (ADR-016) |
| **Tier 1 / 1.5 / 2** | exact / alias-resolved / fuzzy. Tier 1.5 substitutes learned aliases and re-runs the Tier 1 test. (ADR-012) |
| **Anchor** | A reference ID usable for identity. `strong` (payment_id, settlement_id, well-formed RRN) or `weak` (description-extracted, order_id alone). |
| **Exception** | An unmatched or problematic record, classified into one of 8 categories with one primary + secondary flags. |
| **Signature** | The structural shape of a discrepancy, with specifics stripped. The LLM cache key. (ADR-018) |
| **Cold run / warm run** | Without / with learned aliases. Both are always reported, always labelled. (ADR-020) |
| **Leverage ratio** | Records auto-resolved ÷ human corrections made. The alias feature's honest headline. |

## 7. Scope discipline

**In scope** and **explicitly out of scope** are listed in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4 and §5. Read them. They are locked.

Out of scope, and staying out: fraud/risk scoring · cash-flow forecasting · multi-agent frameworks · auth / multi-tenancy / user accounts · mobile · fine-tuning · CQRS/hexagonal · live Razorpay APIs · over-designed UI · **Kubernetes and container orchestration** (ADR-005 — deliberately parked as a separate future learning project).

**If a task feels like it needs something on that list, stop and flag it rather than deciding alone.** The docs contain several items already flagged as scope creep with reasoning — follow that pattern.

---

## 8. Model routing (from ARCHITECTURE §3)

On Claude Pro, Sonnet and Opus share one quota pool, and Opus costs 1.7–5× more per turn. So:

- **Sonnet — the default.** Backend logic, matching engine, classifier, generator, API routes, migrations, LLM integration, tests, and the bulk of frontend implementation once a design direction exists.
- **Opus — planning and taste only.** Architecture passes (`/model opusplan`: Opus plans, Sonnet executes) and the frontend's initial creative pass.
- **Opus — nuclear button.** Hard debugging dead-ends, wrong matching results with no obvious cause, a structural decision clearly gone wrong.
- Clear/compact context between unrelated tasks. Don't leave Opus on after a planning pass ends.

---

## 9. Daily habits

1. **Update `docs/what-broke.md` every single day.** It's a required submission artifact and it cannot be honestly reconstructed on Day 12. One line is fine; blank is not.
2. **Append to `docs/adr-log.md`** whenever you make a decision a future session might otherwise reverse.
3. **Never tune against `HOLDOUT_SEED`.** Develop against `DEV_SEED`. (ADR-027)
4. **Report cold and warm match rates together**, with the false-positive count next to them. (ADR-020)
5. **Run on the full batch, never a subset.** Cherry-picking is the specific thing the track disqualifies.

---

## 10. Current state

**As of 2026-08-24 (Day 2): documentation only. No application code exists yet.**

Day 2 produced the six docs in §3 (plus this file). Implementation had not started as of that date — if `apps/` is still empty when you read this, that is expected, and Day 3's work is scaffolding `apps/api` against [docs/schema.md](docs/schema.md).

Update this section as the build progresses so the next session knows where it is.
